A Perceptron is an artificial neuron, essential for Deep Learning neural networks. Discover its principle, its use, and its importance in Data Science.
To understand what a Perceptron is, you must first understand the concept of an artificial neural network. 
As you probably know, the human brain is made up of billions of neurons.
These neurons are interconnected nerve cells, and allow the processing and transmission of chemical and electrical signals. 
Dendrites are branches receiving information from other neurons. Cell nuclei process information received from dendrites. 
Finally, synapses serve as connections between neurons.
Artificial neurons seek to imitate the functioning of neurons in the brain. This is a mathematical function based on a model of biological neurons. 
Each neuron receives data, weighs it, calculates its sum and produces a result through a non-linear function.
An artificial neural network is made up of multiple artificial neurons. 
The results of the calculations are transmitted from one neuron to another, and each maintains an internal state called an activation signal. The neurons are linked together by connection links, through which information on the input data circulates.
In each neural network, we distinguish the input layer, the output layer, and different hidden layers. Data is passed from one layer to another.
